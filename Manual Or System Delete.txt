1. When add new filed ticket:
It hits the Delivery Doc API (deliverydocs/{orderid})



 A new attachment is added with  

{ "sourceType" : "DeliveryDoc", "Sourceid" : "{deliveryDocId}" }


2. When we delete Manual from the Employee App:

BE API delete: deliverydocs/{id}

DB: 
DelveryDoc:
Statusinfo._id : "deleted"
Attachment:
IsDeleted: false


3. Re added a new Doc

It hits the Delivery Doc API (deliverydocs/{orderid})
DB:

DelveryDoc:
Statusinfo._id : "issued"


4. Updated the same PDF:

BE API delete: deliverydocs/{id}
BE API Created: (deliverydocs/{orderid}) 

DB:

Prev record
DelveryDoc:
Statusinfo._id : "deleted"

DB:

DelveryDoc:
Statusinfo._id : "updated"



Question:

When the delivery doc is deleted from the employee app, do we need to update the status in attachment to mark it as { isDeleted : True }
